# Wheatley

Everyone's favorite AI personality!  


## What is this?

Wheatley is my personal assistant AI project. Where is it going? Who knows.

Built in Python 3.11 to get it working all you need to do is clone, copy .env.example to .env, fill your API keys, setup the .venv and run main.py!

I'll add more details as I become smarter. Or add more potatoes.



All credit goes to Valve and Portal 2 developers for the name.
