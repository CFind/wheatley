# Wheatley

Everyone's favorite AI personality! Once described as:

> "...not just a regular... He's the product of the greatest minds ...who ever lived."

Direct quote!


## What is this?

Wheatley is my personal assistant AI project. Where is it going? Who knows? 

No seriously, I am actually asking who knows. I have no idea.

Built in Python 3.11 to get it working all you need to do is clone, copy .env.example to .env, fill your API keys, setup the .venv and run main.py!

I'll add more details as I become smarter. Or add more potatoes.



All credit goes to Valve Corporation, also known as Valve Software and Portal 2 developers, for the name. Special shoutout to [Stephen Merchant](https://www.stephenmerchant.com/) for his brilliant performance.
